- [ ] Create your app keys in order to be able to use the API.
- [ ] Represent the information received from the requests already made in getArtist and getArtistById, so that, when searching for an artist, the artist's name and a link to make a request to getArtistById (passing the artist's id), an image and the artist's popularity ranking are displayed.
- [ ] And on the other hand, when making a request to getArtistById, the titles and images of the albums found are displayed. In case no artists/albums with the given text are found, a text message like “No artists with this name have been found” should be displayed.
- [ ] Clicking an album will show us the songs of that album.
- [ ] Use the same text box to search for information about a song. As in the example, you will see the results and then you can click on a song in the list to get more information.
